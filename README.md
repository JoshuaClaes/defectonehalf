# defectonehalf
A pythonpackage for doing [DFT-1/2](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.78.125116) calculations with VASP.

## Features
defectonehalf offers a variety of pre- and post-processing procedures tailored for the DFT-1/2 method, focusing on defect calculations with VASP.

## Roadmap
The package is currently in soft release, meaning it's functional but not yet fully polished. The output may not always be easy to follow.
